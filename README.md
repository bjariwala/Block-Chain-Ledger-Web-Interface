# Module_18_Challenge

This application is a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger allows banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## What You're Creating
You’ll make the following updates to the provided Python file, which already contains the basic PyChain ledger structure:

The steps for this are divided into the following sections:

  -- Create a Record Data Class

  -- Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

  -- Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

  -- Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

Change the existing Block data class by replacing the generic data attribute with a record attribute that’s of type Record.

Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record that you’ll store in the PyChain ledger.

Test your complete PyChain ledger.
